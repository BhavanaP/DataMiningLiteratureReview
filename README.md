# DataMiningLiteratureReview
A research work on Data Mining

Mining Software Engineering Repositories describes a broad class of inquiry into the examination of software repositories. This field analyzes the rich amount of data available in software industry such as Metadata information about the software change: user-ids, comments and timestamps. Various differences between the software project versions: adding up, deleting or modifying the code, Classification of different software versions (artifacts) by mining those repositories. In our Literature Review on this topic, we mainly focus on what types of software engineering data are available for mining, methodology being followed in mining the software repositories, general problems being faced in the software Project development cycle, Preprocessing of data and the techniques used for preprocessing, Algorithms mainly used for mining, software engineering tasks that can benefit from mining software engineering data, the data mining techniques that are used in software engineering, the advantages of mining in Software Repositories, challenges in applying the techniques, tools used in mining software repositories and determining the defective software modules etc. The final expected outcome of this review will showcase the advantages of mining software repositories, new approaches to be used for mining, analysis of results from different tools used for mining and the determine some of the best techniques that are published and discussed in the conference papers.
